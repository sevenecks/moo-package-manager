Diff Utilities%%%1.0%%%FFEFAA8CF82F1B010EC10B4747F97A3E%%%This is a repackage & update of the Stunt (Improvise.db) diff tooling. It provides a straightforward way to diff two lists. An example of its usage is diffing current verb code against proposed changes. The package includes a very simple ANSI verb as well that is MOO agnostic and does not rely on any ANSI Utility being setup or configured.%%%1643089149%%%Slither (#2)%%%https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevenecks/moo-package-manager/master/packages/diff_utils_1_0%%%%%%

MOO Package Manager%%%1.4%%%CA50F1ED51E00B402A61E63335DB653B%%%The MOO Package Manager is a configurable utility for packaging code up on one MOO and making it available for installation on another MOO. At the core it is provided with an object which acts as the origin object which is the starting point and primary piece of your package. It then populates and serializes a dependency graph, which is turned into a serialized version (using maps) of your package. The serialized map is then encoded and can then be copied to another MOO / made available online and installed via the MOO Package Manager.
