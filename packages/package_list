Read Selection%%%1.0%%%C0066D76400E5F4FE7A93B30E8D084D3%%%This package adds :read_selection and :read_selection_with_options to your $command_utils. These two verbs make it easier to prompt for user input (like picking an '1' from a list of items that was displayed) and gracefully handles them entering completely bogus selections.%%%1642570867%%%Fengshui (#22664)%%%https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevenecks/moo-package-manager/master/packages/read_selection_1_0%%%
MOO Package Manager%%%1.0%%%7DE9B8130FE92EBEFE91AD52C87A489B%%%The MOO Package Manager is a configurable utility for packaging code up on one MOO and making it available for installation on another MOO. At the core it is provided with an object which acts as the origin object which is the starting point and primary piece of your package. It then populates and serializes a dependency graph, which is turned into a serialized version (using maps) of your package. The serialized map is then encoded and can then be copied to another MOO / made available online and installed via the MOO Package Manager.

Diff Utilities%%%1.0%%%55EDCD5E087F8A501F984C1B335150CB%%%This is a repackage & update of the Stunt (Improvise.db) diff tooling. It provides a straightforward way to diff two lists. An example of its usage is diffing current verb code against proposed changes. The package includes a very simple ANSI verb as well that is MOO agnostic and does not rely on any ANSI Utility being setup or configured.%%%1642560590%%%Fengshui (#22664)%%%https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevenecks/moo-package-manager/master/packages/diff_utils_1_0%%%added mpm version
Map Utilities%%%1.0%%%25E4D0C0B068D6FFEE4F870DC8762913%%%A very basic $map_utils that provides two verbs currently. 'map_print' pretty prints a map and 'dotkey' accepts a map and a string in the form of 'slither.stats.strength' and then indexes into the map such that the returned result is the value of map["slither"]["stats"]["strength"].%%%1642560697%%%Fengshui (#22664)%%%https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevenecks/moo-package-manager/master/packages/map_utils_1_0%%%added mpm version
